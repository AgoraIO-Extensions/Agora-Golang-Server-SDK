# Build and run examples
```
make deps
make build
make examples
cd ./bin
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../agora_sdk
# for mac, use command bellow
# export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=../agora_sdk_mac
./multi_cons_rtx -h
```

# Intergrate into your project
- Clone this repository and checkout to the target branch, and install
```
git clone git@github.com:AgoraIO-Extensions/Agora-Golang-Server-SDK.git
cd Agora-Golang-Server-SDK
git checkout dev/2.0
make install
```
- Add the following dependency to your go.mod
```
replace github.com/AgoraIO-Extensions/Agora-Golang-Server-SDK/v2 => /path/to/Agora-Golang-Server-SDK

require github.com/AgoraIO-Extensions/Agora-Golang-Server-SDK/v2 v2.0.4
```
- Add import in your go file
```
import (
  agoraservice "github.com/AgoraIO-Extensions/Agora-Golang-Server-SDK/v2/go_sdk/agoraservice"
)
```
- Call agoraservice interface in your code
```
	svcCfg := agoraservice.NewAgoraServiceConfig()
	svcCfg.AppId = appid
	agoraservice.Initialize(svcCfg)
```

# vad usage
- call NewAudioVad to create a new vad instance
- call ProcessPcmFrame to process one audio frame, the frame is a slice of 16 bits,16khze and mono pcm
data,
- ProcessPcmFrame(frame *PcmInAudioFrame) (*PcmOutAudioFrame, int) is a function with a dual return - value, indicating an update of the speech state. The int parameter represents the current Voice Activity Detection (VAD) state, where:

- 0 represents no speech detected;
- 1 represents the start of speech;
- 2 represents speech in progress;
- 3 represents the end of the current speech segment;
- -1 represents an error occurred.
- If the function is in states 1, 2, or 3, the PcmOutAudioFrame will contain the PCM data corresponding to the VAD state.

- When a user wants to perform ASR/TTS processing, they should send the data from the PcmOutAudioFrame to the ASR system.
- call Release() when the vad instance is no longer needed
-- NOTEï¼š 
- The VAD instance should be released after the ASR system is no longer needed.
- One VAD instance corresponds to one audio stream

# FAQ
## compile error
### undefined symbol reference to GLIBC_xxx
- libagora_rtc_sdk depends on GLIBC 2.16 and above
- libagora_uap_aed depends on GLIBC 2.27 and above
- solutions are:
  - you can upgrade your glibc if possible, or you will need to upgrade your running system to **required os version**
  - if you don't use VAD, and your glibc version is between 2.16 and 2.27, you can disable VAD by rename **audio_vad.go** file in go_sdk/agoraserver/ to **audio_vad.go.bak**
